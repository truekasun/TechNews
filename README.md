**TechNews** is a simple android application that built to reach the latest tech-news based on the [Softpedia News](http://news.softpedia.com/) RSS feeds. There are no android application available for the softpedia news at the moment I'm writing this. The reason I wanted to build this application was to fullfill my need of having an app to read the softpedia news on the go.
